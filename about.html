           So this research is for us to determine how can music affect our anxiety?
           or what genre does people who have high level anxiety often listen to.
           Here we will show you the bar graph of the qualitative datas and
           for the quantitative the histograms will be shown.
           The data was collected by use of a Google Form that was disseminated through many social media
           platforms and even advertised in public locations by the data collectors. The survey itself was
           made brief by the people gathering data for the survey to be easily answerable, and they got 
           700+ responses in a day due to this. The dataset is considered to be a population as the data 
           collectors collected as many responses as possible. For our qualitative variables, we have the 
           participantsâ€™ tastes in music and their anxiety levels, which are nominal and ordinal variables respectfully. 
           And for our quantitative data, we have their ages, which are measured in years, 
           and how much they listen to music, which is measured in hours per day.
