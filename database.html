       The qualitative data in the study of favorite genre shows that the Rock genre, 
       has 188 responses, meaning that a huge number of the respondents listen to rock music.
        Meanwhile, the genre with the least responses is 
        Latin music, with only 3 responses, meaning that only a very small percentage of the 
        respondents listen to Latin music. and for the Anxiety level, the one that had the most answers was level 7, 
        with 122 respondents, which can mean that a lot of the survey respondents are very anxious. 
        The anxiety level with the least answers was level 7.5 , with only 1 respondent,
         which can mean that only this particular respondent is slightly more anxious than the people with anxiety level 7.
