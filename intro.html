            Hi everyone this website will be introducing you to our statistics project, wherein we tried to study and build a 
            statistial report sing a data set from koggle on how 
            music can affect our anxiety. Music is a big part of many people’s lives, and through 
            the data set we have collected,  
            we can see how much of life music really affects. Specifically, we can find how much a person’s 
            anxiety is affected by the type of music they listen to and how much they listen to everyday. 
            While researching, we came across a data set that contained many helpful bits of information about this topic.
            The individuals in this data set are people who listen to music during their day-to-day activities,
            while the variables include the ages of the participants, how often they listen to music per day in hours, 
            their favorite genre of music, and their anxiety levels on a numerical scale of 1-10.
